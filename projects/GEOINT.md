## What is GEOINT and IMINT?

In the intelligence community, these two disciplines are often linked together for good reason. Geospatial Intelligence in the words of the National Geospatial Agency is:
> GEOINT is the exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information that describes, assesses and visually depicts physical features and geographically referenced activities on the Earth.
Imagery Intelligence in the words of the U.S Naval War College is:
> Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) includes representations of objects reproduced electronically or by optical means on film, electronic display devices, or other media. Imagery can be derived from visual photography, radar sensors, infrared sensors, lasers, and electro-optics.
