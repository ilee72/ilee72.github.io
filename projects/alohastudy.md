## Introduction & Motivation
This project was for our ICS 314 Software Engineering class. The purpose of our project was to create a website that would allow students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This was done by creating a list of study spots that contained information pertinent to the spot as well as a way for users to comment and rate the spot. We wanted to provide students study spots for the upcoming Finals Exam Week. This project was also going to be a test of what we have learned throughout our ICS 314 class and was to demonstrate our knowledge of using our IDE effectively along with REACT and METEOR. We were to use jsx to design and implement our website as well as practicing to work in a team with a design pattern to test out.

## What we did
In this project, we built a landing page for our homepage. We then built a page to add spots, edit spots, list spots, admin page, and adminst list spot page. It also contains a sign in and sign up page as well. In the add spots and edit spots, we can determine the metadata of the spot itself as we can add images, names, and conditions of each spot. From there, the listing would be posted and depending on the user being verified or unverified, the admin can allow the post to be on the list spots or deleted. Users can go to profiles and access the information of users. Users can also click on certain spots and see a larger portion that shows comments and allows for users to rate. Admins have access to the admin list spot to verify listings or delete them. They can also access the admin page which allows them to go through all users.
