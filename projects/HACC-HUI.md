# Context to HACC 2020

The Hawaii Annual Code Challenge would bring approximately 200 developers every year. This amount of participants made forming teams a difficult task for participants and administrators. This obstacle became more apparent when the pandemic happened which resulted in no in-person meeting for [HACC 2020](https://hacc.hawaii.gov/). ICS 414 Software Engineering II was tasked by the hackathon hosts to build an application that allowed for easy registration and team formation for participants. This application used tool we used from ICS 314 including React, Meteor, MongoDB, and Semantic-UI. This was the first time ICS 414 would take on such a task and it was unprecendented. 

# Team Deployments

At the beginning of the semester, we were split into teams of four to five. I was part of team MIJJ which had the first letters of our names from Manalu, Isaac, Joshua and Joel. During the first half of the semester, our team worked on milestone's with four to five issues with each being claimed by each member. We would use Discord to decide which issues we wanted and would then implement the issues by ourselves. If we ran into any issues, we would immediately ask for help on discord. The other members of my team did more of leadership and asking questions while I took requests. 

This system went on for Milestone 1 and 2 when we were able to finish these issues and grab the best of the implementations from teams. However, due to time constraints and the inability to get the code from different sources to merge well, we eventually moved toward working from one master repository to ensure that there would be code interoperability amongst 20+ coders. Within this Final Sprint, we more or less broke our teams and started working on individual tasks from a large list of issues. Eventually, I cooperated with people with issues that were interconnected with mine. Communication became ad hoc with questions and I even went to other random members asking for advice on how to implement code to solve an issue. 

I became heavily invested in the implementation of the Slack bot and database so I worked heavily with Wei Mai who had experience with the database. At the same time, I had working accounts and could help provide quality assurance and testing for the database and Slack for Wei as well. Together, we were able to go over issues regarding the database as it was directly correlated with the Slack Bot's functionality which was what I focused on. 

# Milestones and Final Sprint

# Conclusion
ICS 414's project was one of the most intense experiences to date. It was stressful trying to keep up with other schoolwork and then invest hours into trying to make an issue work. I felt that a quarter of the time was spent trying to make Meteor and React to work by troubleshooting;the other quarter was spent trying to research how to implement the functionality needed and that the other half of time was spent trying to make it work. The time constraints were definitely one of the hardest aspects of the work and it feels very closely to real world development cycles. I realized how I had to manage my time and priorities as well as rely heavily on my team and, later, other members associated to my tasks. 

I felt that the communication platforms such as Discord was far superior to Slack in that it allowed for Voice over IP calls within the platform. It was also more robust and simple than Slack which required lots of troubleshooting on my part. Additional functionality like the search bar which allowed me to look at past conversations or screen sharing was so useful. This convenience saved time and energy which outshined Slack. I would definitely recommend using Discord over Slack. 

This was an intense but rewarding project that had me proud of the work I did. I was able to show my friends, who were HACC 2020 participants, the work we did. Furthermore, it had motivated me to work harder on learning Javascript and other tools such as MongoDB and Semantic-UI. I wanted to match my peers who were able to complete their tasks with ease and I now want to get to their level. Overall, I feel that I accomplished a lot and I now have something to look back on after graduation.
