## Never heard of this

I've always seen ads on youtube (I should download adblocker) about a software program called grammarly that would call out mistakes made in the English language. The people in the ad state that they always use Grammarly for major essays and emails that they need to write.
I've also never used an IDE before in my life, so this has been a very new experience for me. ESLint and IDE are new to me and they remind of grammarly which checks for spelling. IntelliJ seems very similar to Visual Studios or Roblox Studios, but I've never used them before. I just know they are very useful 

## So many errors

ESLint always seems to find errors with my spacing, indentation, and even my way of trying to write a function. With one the WODs I forgot to turn ESLint on; I turned it back on and it gave me around ten to twenty errors which I spent the next ten minutes trying to fix. I understand that I'm new to javascript, but come on, twenty errors because of indentation and spacing. So with that fixed, it did feel nice to have something very tidy to look at. I find ESLint to be very empowering to the user since it is always like a reminder to never feel comfortable. It something to keep people from thinking they are perfect as it always reminds you that you too can make mistakes. It was frustating my own "creativity" into writing my code was limited by ESLint, but ESLint does provide an avenue to more "professional" styles of writing code which helps with the reading of my code to others. 

## ESLint as a tool

I don't like ESLint because it gives you only a narrow view of how to write code. I've written code for C and it's possible to make it look neat and tidy for others to read. The amount of errors for certain ways to write string, spacing, and functions is pretty annoying in my opinion. And I think sometimes people want their own code to be read in their own way, and I am absolutely for having coders express creativity in their own way. Although, I've mentioned in the previous paragraph, ESLint is a powerful tool and if you are going to have an organization where you want others to use a standard operating procedure for formatting and writing out code, ESLint is the right tool to ensure standardization of code. I can definitely see the positive side of having people conform to a set style if you spread out multiple people over a large project.
