## Introduction 
Everyone is always busy with their lives and problems; and making time for a person is one of the greatest gifts a person can give. 
So, it is very essential for anyone asking for someones' time to be thoughtful and considerate for the time and energy spent when someone decides to help a person.
The best way to show such gratitude is to put thought and effort into a problem before asking a question. This means to maybe research or try to solve this problem before giving up to asking questions.
Then you should give as much essential information and context to the question so that those that wish to help do not have to do extra work that could have been done by the one asking the question.
This allows for those that answer questions to add more time and thought to answering the question and giving guidance.

## What a question should contain

Besides the obvious manner of having grammar and appropriate words, the usage of other technical techniques to ensure a proper resposne to a question
are necessary. Judging from all questions that have many responses that were timely and helpful, I saw three things that made this possible.
First, the title of the forum question was concise and summarized the issue that the person was asking for. This would usually be a title that I saw like, "Set padding for UITextField with UITextBorderStyleNone" or "Disable redirect for specific requests with the same client using HTTPClient." From what I see from these titles, these show a way to direct the object/topic of the question and the direction of the question. This makes it easier for others to understand what you are experiencing. 

Second, I saw that these questions provided context to their problem, such as what they were doing or what they were trying to accomplish. In this way, the audience already knows your goals and can create their answers to tailor very closely to the goals of the person. Also, context such as code, background information, or equipment provides additional information that can show how you reached the issue is very helpful to those willing to help. It prevents them from having to make assumptions on certain essential elements of the problem.

Third, I saw that the questions were very specific and technical compared to others. The questions provided certain jargon and specificity that only those familiar in the field could understand the problem. This way, the question asks narrows down on individuals who are familiar with the subject rather than those who are new to it or have never heard of it. Technical jargon also allows for very specific issues which allows for those helping to narrow down their efforts to help solve the issue. 

There were not as many bad questions. The majority of questions were specific, however, there were some sub-par questions that were of poor grammar and were vague and uninteresting. They asked very basic questions that could be searched up on the internet. These questions were with very few views and even fewer answers.

## Interest in questions 
I saw interest in the questions as a great way to see if your question was great or poor. The amount of views and answers were only a implication of the type of question you had. It showed the amount of interest that the question generated and was a great indicator of a great question. Within these responses to the question, many showed enthusiasm in the challenge of the problem and loved to explain and show the corrections or solutions to such questions. Within these responses, others would ask more questions or provide alternate solutions and it would eventually snowball into other topics. When the amount of alternate solutions and the asking of more questions occurs, I saw that the questions that created more interest in depth of a topic were the greatest.

I saw this question generate a lot of interest and work into this problem. Although it seems rough, the author of the question provided context to his question as well as edits to his inforation in his question.
