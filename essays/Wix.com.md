## It was pretty fun...
You know, I didn't know a thing or two about html and css. I had zero idea it would be this difficult and fun to actually build websites. Most of the youtube ads I would see would be about wix.com that showed a very attractive or charming person that owns some type of business. These people seemingly have no time to focus on building a website and like to show how easy and fun it is to build a website using Wix. From what I've found from these WODs, I've learned that it is very difficult and time consuming to build the website, but I've also learned that it was fun to solve such a puzzle to experiment and build to create something of my own. Gosh, it was time-consuming, (I've spent around 5 hours on the Practice WOD to build your own website of your choice), that it was frustrating but enjoyable to try to solve something.
