## It was pretty fun...
You know, I didn't know a thing or two about html and css. I had zero idea it would be this difficult and fun to actually build websites. Most of the youtube ads I would see would be about wix.com that showed a very attractive or charming person that owns some type of business. These people seemingly have no time to focus on building a website and like to show how easy and fun it is to build a website using Wix. From what I've found from these WODs, I've learned that it is very difficult and time consuming to build the website, but I've also learned that it was fun to solve such a puzzle to experiment and build to create something of my own. Gosh, it was time-consuming, (I've spent around 5 hours on the Practice WOD to build your own website of your choice), that it was frustrating but enjoyable to try to solve something.

## HTML or CSS?

Through this week, I've learned that there are so many ways to do something. That freedom to choose to use both tools to build a website has been the most fun. Should I use <div style="font-family: .... or should I use css for font-family: ....? These different ways to do so many things is what made it fun to build websites. I preferred using HTML for singular elements to edit and make while using CSS to edit large quantities of elements that required them to be uniform. Moreover, HTML and CSS, although a bit ugly, they allowed for modulization and customizability comapared to semantic UI. What I didn't like about semantic UI was how stubborn it was to use. Everytime I had problems with it, it was hard to find the problem as well as how limited it was in it's specific function. However, with HTML or CSS, it is easy to "brute" force your way to meld HTML code to fit a parameter to fit the look of a website.

## Pizza Hut

My most difficult and time consuming part for this week was the attempt to recreate the Pizza Hut website. I underestimated the complexity of the Pizza Hut website and paid for it with approximately four to five hours of time trying to figure out how to implement Semantic UI to build the website. One part of learning to build this website was the use of cards and ways to add buttons and comments within cards. I have to admit I was pretty proud to have built something very similar to the pizza hut website. Even with the limitations of Semantic UI that frustrated me, such as trying to put words within a picture or trying to find the correct buttons, it was a great experience to build that website.
