## "All warfare is based on deception."
The Art of War could be considered a design pattern for winning or losing war. As war is an endeavor of life and death of an nation-state, we can compare this to life and death for an engineer. For the endeavor of whatever he is doing is critical and people depend on the engineer's work to be flawless to prevent disasters in the future. Then we can also see that design patterns for engineers are standard operating procedures in creation of new designs. Same can be said for the conflict of nation-states against each other; their design patterns could be similar to wisdom that was shared in our history. The Art of War is a treatise that brought forth ideas of tactics, logistics, and strategy that could be applied for design of plans for nation-state conflicts covertly and overtly. Design patterns are also seen as proven strategies and tactics that can be applied in all points of development in creating new innovations. We would use the design patterns to speed up development and provide oversight to ensure success in our design, similar to how strategist or think tanks would apply the Art of War to their purposes.
